We are making a cruise management system called CrusMan

This is a spike branch to try out different data management systems for CrusMan. The two options we are choosing between are using an SQL database and simply storing the objects locally using the java.io serialization classes. 

The benefits of an SQL database is it is more organized, faster, and would allow us to have more up-to-date analytics. The downsides is that it would be more work/mental overhead to build the database and connect it to our program. Additionally, the customer hosting their program would now need a separate database host to hold their data.

The benefits to the naive approach with serialization is it will be easier on our end programming, and could allow the entire program to run locally with a monolithic design. The downsides are speed and potentially data consistency. 

"I think using a database would probably be better, but I am lazy and don't want to figure out where to host it, and I don't wanna remember how to use SQL in java." -Sebastien
